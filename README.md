Web API using ASP.NET Core as the backend.

Using a SQLite database with data of stocks currently on the S&P500 scraped using Python.

Would like to display daily stock data as well information that isn't typically shown on stock sites like as monthly averages and standard deviations of each stock. Also would like to display information like the S&P500's sector by sector performance.

For now, planning on using plain html, css, and javascript for frontend.
